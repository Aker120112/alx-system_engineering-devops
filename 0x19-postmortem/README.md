 Web Application Outage on August 15, 2024
Issue Summary:

    Duration: August 15, 2024, 10:00 AM - 11:30 AM UTC (1 hour 30 minutes)
    Impact: The web application slowed down significantly, affecting 70% of users. API response times also degraded, leading to intermittent failures.
    Root Cause: A sudden traffic spike overwhelmed the database due to unoptimized queries, causing connection saturation.

Timeline:

    10:05 AM: Monitoring alert for slow response times.
    10:07 AM: On-call engineer began investigating error logs.
    10:10 AM: Initial focus on possible DDoS attack.
    10:20 AM: Shifted focus to database performance.
    10:30 AM: Misleading investigation into recent deployment.
    10:45 AM: Escalated to the database team.
    11:00 AM: Identified unoptimized queries as the bottleneck.
    11:15 AM: Applied query optimizations and connection adjustments.
    11:30 AM: System stabilized.

Root Cause and Resolution:

    Root Cause: Unoptimized database queries under heavy traffic caused connection saturation and slow response times.
    Resolution: Optimized problematic queries, increased database connection limits, and added necessary indexes.

Corrective and Preventative Measures:

    Improvements:
        Audit and optimize database queries.
        Implement load testing to simulate traffic spikes.
        Enhance monitoring for better database performance tracking.

    Tasks:
        Optimize existing database queries.
        Adjust connection pool limits.
        Add indexes to frequently queried columns.
        Integrate load testing into the CI/CD pipeline.
        Update monitoring to include database-specific alerts.
