Web Application Outage on August 15, 2024
Issue Summary:

    Duration: August 15, 2024, 10:00 AM - 11:30 AM UTC (1 hour 30 minutes)
    Impact: The web application slowed down to the pace of a dial-up connection, affecting 70% of users. API responses were as reliable as a Wi-Fi signal in a concrete bunker, leading to intermittent failures.
    Root Cause: A traffic spike overwhelmed the database, which wasn’t optimized—like trying to run modern games on a 90s PC.

Timeline:

    10:05 AM: Monitoring alert triggered—servers felt the need for speed, but the database had other plans.
    10:07 AM: On-call engineer started investigating; error logs were piling up faster than spam emails.
    10:10 AM: Assumed it was a DDoS attack—turns out the only "denial of service" was our own database.
    10:20 AM: Focus shifted to database performance, which was lagging more than a video call on 2G.
    10:30 AM: Misleading path: Checked the latest deployment—turns out, blaming new code was like blaming your keyboard for typos.
    10:45 AM: Database team was called in—like summoning Gandalf when things got dark.
    11:00 AM: Unoptimized queries were found—queries so slow, they made turtles look like Olympic sprinters.
    11:15 AM: Optimized queries and increased connection limits—finally, things started moving at a reasonable pace.
    11:30 AM: System stabilized—users rejoiced, and the servers sighed in relief.

Root Cause and Resolution:

    Root Cause: Unoptimized database queries couldn't handle the traffic spike, much like trying to multitask with 2GB of RAM.
    Resolution: Optimized the slow queries, increased the database connection limits, and added indexes—basically upgrading our database from a tricycle to a sports car.

Corrective and Preventative Measures:

    Improvements:
        Audit and optimize database queries—because nobody likes waiting for a webpage to load like it’s 1999.
        Implement load testing—let’s see how the system handles stress, just like a laptop with 50 Chrome tabs open.
        Enhance monitoring—because flying blind is only fun in video games.

    Tasks:
        Optimize existing database queries—no more queries stuck in the slow lane.
        Adjust connection pool limits—more connections, less congestion.
        Add indexes—making our database searches faster than a search engine.
        Integrate load testing—ensure the system doesn't break a sweat under pressure.
        Update monitoring—better tracking, fewer surprises.

This incident reminds us that even the most powerful systems can stumble—just like everyone eventually does on a tricky CAPTCHA.
